# Cognitive Score Model (Behavioral Intelligence Estimate)

## 🧠 Hypothesis

Traditional "g" models tend to reduce intelligence to testable traits: logic, reasoning, pattern recognition.

However, this is a **narrow definition** of what it means to be a cognitively mature human being.

I propose a more **behaviorally embodied** model — intelligence not as performance on abstract problems, but as:

- **Wise attention** (low addictive screen exposure, high content quality)
- **Self-directed reflection** (attitude & environment)
- **Behavioral maturity** (tobacco usage, lifestyle)

The resulting `cognitive_score` is **not a clinical IQ**, but a **general cognitive-health index**, based on real-world behavior patterns.
